* dlgpu_assistant: This library has some tools that I believe are usefull for creating ANN.
  - In just one sentence you will know if your GPU is available for the training process. 
  - It has its own data preprocessing structure which makes much easier preprare the data for DL. 
  - You can create a model just passing the necessary hyperparameter, the library creates the structure for you. 
  - You will be able to register your ANN performance along the process of adjust the hyperparameters.
